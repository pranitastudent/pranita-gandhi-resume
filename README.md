# The Resume- Mini Project
The resume project was build as mini project as part of the User Centric Front-End development module. The website allows future recruiters and potential clients to view my technicial web development skills in terms of design and code in real time as the website is used to market my skills. The resume project incorporates everything learned so far in the course. The resume is split into four sections which are navagated through a navagation bar with each  section coloured in bright vibrant colours and each section depicting its fontawesome icon. The four sections are ; home page, resume , contact and download.
Each page contains the same Header and Footer. The Header coloured charcoal for clarity depicts my name and title clearly as well as well as a photo of myself on the righthand side. The Footer also coloured charcoal to match the header contains an 'About' section which states my current position as well as links to my social media pages where clients and future recruiters can chose to look at. A traditional 'download CV' link is provided for recruiters to download and print off a copy of my CV.<br>


### The Home Page <br>

The home page contains my personal details so potential recruiters and clients can contact me. It also contains three detailed reasons as why to hire me.<br>

### The Resume Page <br>

The resume page states my front-end and back-end skills gained so far and a fontawesome icon is assigned to the front-end and back-end title. The left handside depicts my work history in the form of a time line and a pruple colour is chosed as its background for clarity.


### The Contact Page <br>

The contact page includes a form allows  potential recruiters and clients to contact me. 

### Download CV <br>

My CV can be downloaded by clicking on the navagation link 'Download CV'
